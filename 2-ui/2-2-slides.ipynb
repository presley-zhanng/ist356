    "\n",
    "Streamlit markets itself as a User Interface library for building simple web applications from Python scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Build:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interactive dashboard with tables, charts and graphs\n",
    "- Accepting user input for a data pipeline\n",
    "- Chat applications \n",
    "- and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part of streamlit is the application runs in a browser and you don't need to learn front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript\n"

    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `2-hello.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write python code that uses the streamlit library Example: `2-hello.py`\n",
    "2. Run the python with the streamlit library: `python -m streamlit run 2-hello.py`  \n",
    "**NOTE:** In VS Code, there is a `launch.json` configured for you, so:\n",
    "    1. Open \"Run and Debug\" in the action bar: VS Code => Menu => View => Run\n",
    "    2. Under RUN AND DEBUG, choose **Streamlit Run** and press the green play button\n",
    "3. streamlit launches a webserver on your computer to run your app.  \n",
    "A web browser will open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)\n",
    "4. The app will continue to run in the browser you can edit and re-run without step 2!"

    "The most effective way to use of this pattern is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Streamlit supports both linear and event-driven interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **event-driven** interactions, you write a function to handle the event. This is similar to how most other UI libraries work. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The event-driven pattern is more complex, and might have unexpected behaviors due to streamlit's processing order**\n",
    "\n",
